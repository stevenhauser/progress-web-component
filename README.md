# progress-bar web component

![progress web component in all its gory glory](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/963631/3712718/32919e66-152d-11e4-9852-60888c63c421.png)

This is a simple web component experiment that is a progress
bar with an output node. It's not meant to be used for *anything*
and is purely an experiment to learn about web components, plus
some ES6 stuff like `WeakMap`, `let`, etc. None of the code in
here represents a good practice; it's all just a good time.

"Works" in latest Chrome.
